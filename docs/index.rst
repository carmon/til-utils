Welcome to til-utils documentation
==================================

`til-utils` (working title) is a Github Application that aims to transform any Github repository into a static blog.
It's a personal project that after talking with some friends I decided to make it more generic and approachable for people who is not me.
At the moment you'll need a technical skill to use it (git, JS), but the overall goal is to make 
everything work directly from Github web UI.
